* make `genemail.util.emailRegex_cre` configurable

* genemail failed to correctly extract only one email address from this:

    To: "Donna Cotarella@aol.com" <donnacostrella@aol.com>

* preserve XML-based comments in output html... "if in the input, put in the output"
  ==> make optional!
  ==> maybe add special syntax for having both be possible?, eg:
        <email:comment>the comment</email:comment>
      becomes
        <!-- the comment -->

* adding two "To" email headers does not result in two recipients... eg:
     <email:header name="To">a@example.com</email:header>
     <email:header name="To">b@example.com</email:header>
  results in 'To: a@example.com' instead of 'To: a@example.com, b@example.com'

* add documentation about:
  * Manager.default
  * Email.structure
  * Modifiers
  * ... and much more

* add `less` support for CSS via lesscpy

* add ability to add modifiers on a per-email basis
  ==> maybe controlled/configured by <email:modifier .../> ?...
  ==> or possibly by email.spec ?...

* add a MIME prolog? eg:

    This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

  *just in case* some email is received by a non-MIME aware reader.
  (say whaaa?)

* switch to use asset.isstr() -- search for isinstance()...

* the PgpModifier implements PGP/MIME (RFC 3156), add support for:
  * inline-PGP

* add S/MIME (RFC 5750) modifier for certificate-based encryption
  (makes much more sense in server environments)

* technically, this package is not zip-safe, but *only* for testing
  of the pgp modifier (since it uses gpg, an external program, which
  needs access to the test_data/gpg-* folders). what to do about that?

* support directproject.org?...

* add a Modifier base class parameter 'failaction' = {'abort', 'ignore'}

* if 'Date' header is not a str, render it:
    int => as epoch
    tuple => as timetuple
    datetime => as datetime

* use unittest.Skip(...) for unittests that skip...
