* add documentation about:
  * Manager.default
  * Email.structure
  * Modifiers
  * ... and much more

* add `less` support for CSS via lesscpy

* add ability to add modifiers on a per-email basis
  ==> maybe controlled/configured by <email:modifier .../> ?...
  ==> or possibly by email.spec ?...

* add a MIME prolog? eg:

    This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

  *just in case* some email is received by a non-MIME aware reader.
  (say whaaa?)

* switch to use asset.isstr() -- search for isinstance()...
